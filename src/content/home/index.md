# Hi, I am Renish

I am an Information Technology undergraduate at [IIIT Vadodara](https://iiitvadodara.ac.in), currently bridging the gap between hardware and software.

While my academic background covers the full spectrum of Computer Science, my passion lies in **Embedded Systems** and **low-level programming**. I am a builder who enjoys understanding how things work from the bare metal up to the application layer.

### My Engineering Stack

I primarily work on **embedded systems**, focusing on performance and real-time constraints. My technical playground includes:

* **Bare-Metal Development:** I enjoy the control of bare-metal C programming on [AVR](https://github.com/avrdudes/avr-libc) and [pico-series](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html) boards.
* **RTOS & Frameworks:** I build scalable IoT solutions using [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html) for the ESP32 (utilizing [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/)) and [STM32Cube](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) with VSCode for STM32 microcontrollers. [cite: 2]
* **Hardware-Software Integration:** My projects range from creating Bluetooth-based wireless mice using **MPU6500** sensors to developing synced Pomodoro timers that communicate via MQTT.
* I occasionally perform **web development** in [React]() and [Astro]() for dashboards and static pages.

### Systems & Security

I am deep in the rabbit hole of **self-hosting** and the **GNU/Linux** ecosystem.

* **Daily Drivers:** I currently daily-drive [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop) and [Debian](https://debian.org).
* **Infrastructure:** I manage my own self-hosted services, which has naturally led me to learn **computer networking** and **cybersecurity** practices to keep my home lab secure.
* **Cybersecurity:** I spend some of my free time learning security fundamentals to solidify in the domain.

### My other interests

* I love cooking and exploring new culinary techniques and cuisines—it’s just chemistry with better taste testing.
* I am an amateur [Geoguessr](https://geoguessr.com) player which naturally brought my interest travelling the world and understanding global geography.
* I am a huge [Age of Empires 2](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aoeiide/) fan. While I'm not into playing games, I enjoy watching pro streams alot.
* I occasionally write blogs of my favourite topics. Check them out here ->
